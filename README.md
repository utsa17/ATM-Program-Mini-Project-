# ATM-Program: OPPs Mini Project

When creating the ATM program, the class objects are created under a class and these objects have variables with an associated behaviour. For instance, when depositing funds into an account, the balance will increase and with withdraw of funds the balance will decrease but never go below a fund of amount of INR 0.00. Input 4 digit user pin for authentication. You have to input user pin double times and check whether they are equal. If pin is found okay, ask for the input selection of numbers from 1 to 4. If selection is 1, Check saving balance and print the balance. If selection is 2, Deposit funds from the user and print the saving balance after deposit. If selection is 3, Withdraw funds from the savings balance account and print the balance after withdrawal. If selection is 4, Transfer funds from checking balance to savings balance. For this, you have to initially create the variable for checking balance and assign some amount to that variable. If selection 4 is made, the amount from checking balance must be debited and credited to saving account. Then, you have to print the balance in checking balance and saving balance. If selection is other than 1 to 4, print invalid choice and exit the loop.
